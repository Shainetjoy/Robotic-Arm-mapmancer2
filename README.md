# Robotic-Arm-mapmancer2
A wireless robotic car with a 4-DOF arm controlled via dual joysticks. The master Arduino sends commands through Bluetooth to the slave unit, which drives DC motors and servos for movement and object handling. Smooth mapped control ensures precise motion with safety limits to prevent jerks.
